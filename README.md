# qube_task

A Flutter Project created using GET_CLI and managed using GETX state management.

PS: Some things may differ in looks based on data fetched by the API. For instance, the feeling percentages bar will be shown translucent, this is because I think if the feeling percentage is 0, that widget is considered to be OFF. If there is any change in % the value of feelings, it will be opaque and visible as intended.

## Getting Started

Ensure that you run :
 flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs.
 and, 
 flutter pub get

And you are good to go!!
